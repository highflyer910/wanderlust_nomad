As I know the city is filled with fado houses that offer an intimate setting for listening to this beautiful music. \nBut Lisbon is not just about music, and architecture. It's a city with a rich history that is evident in its historic buildings and monuments. I'm looking forward to exploring the Belem Tower, the Jeronimos Monastery, and the National Museum of Ancient Art to learn more about Lisbon's fascinating past. \nI can't wait to immerse myself in the city's culture and traditions, listen to fado music, ride the famous trams, and discover the city's hidden gems."

            "Madeira is a stunning island located off the coast of Portugal, and it's a must-visit for travelers who love nature and breathtaking views. I started to research about this place after I watched a short video in Tik Tok:) Here are some spots to visit there: \n- Pico do Arieiro: This is the third-highest peak on the island, and it offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. People can drive up to the peak or take a hiking trail to reach the top. \n- Levada Walks: The island is famous for its Levada walks, which are hiking trails that follow the water channels that distribute water from the mountainous areas to the farmland. These walks offer spectacular views of the island's forests, waterfalls, and cliffs. \n- Funchal: This charming city is the capital of Madeira Island and is known for its picturesque streets, colorful houses, and stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. Be sure to visit the Mercado dos Lavradores, a famous market where you can find fresh fruits, vegetables, and fish. \n- Monte Palace Tropical Garden: This is a beautiful garden located in Funchal, and it features exotic plants, lakes, and sculptures. You can also visit the Monte Palace Museum, which houses an impressive collection of African, Indo-Portuguese, and Oriental art. \n- Cabo Girao: This is the second-highest sea cliff in the world, and it offers panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean. You can walk on a glass-bottomed platform that extends over the cliff's edge and take in the stunning views."
